This is a Chrome Extension to search and open Google Drive files directly from the omnibox. To search, type 'gd' and press TAB in the omnibox, and then enter your search query!

To use it, you must first authorize Google Drive metadata read-only access to the extension by following these instructions (see screenshots):

1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Find this extension, and click "Options"
3. Click "Authorize", and then click "Accept" to grant the extension access. This will redirect to a blank page. Close it, and refresh the options page.
4. If you see "You have already authorized this extension!", then you can now search!
